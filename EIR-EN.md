## 2.4. Level of Information Need

The development of the tables with the Level of Information Need (EN ISO 7817-1:2024) to be followed in the various exchanges of information between the different actors is the responsibility of the lead appointed party. The tables must be contained in the BEP, and this document presents reference tables with minimum requirements. Appointed parties must add alphanumeric information that has not been provided for in the aforementioned tables and that is relevant to characterising the project objects. The IFC model must also contain information that makes it possible to relate the object to the bill of quantities.

Level of Information Need tables:
* [General](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k83QjVxPOW7c3up-CIHF8iAWr-czL6S-ydMOzpceqFA/edit?usp=sharing)

## 3.2. Methods and procedures for producing project information

Project information production methods and procedures define the approaches and techniques that the appointing party uses to create, manage and approve information.

### 3.2.1 Capturing information from existing assets

As there has been no previous construction on the site and the updated topographical survey is available in the Reference Information (and complies with Lisbon City Council requirements), no information capture of this type is expected to be necessary.

There is a need to survey the surroundings using methods that provide sufficient information for the permiting process and for analysing shading and occlusions.

The appointed parties will be responsible for defining the requirements to be met in order to prepare the geological-geotechnical report needed for the structural design. The appointing party will independently award and contract the work related to the preparation of the geological-geotechnical report.

---

### 3.2.2. Creation, revision and approval of new information

#### a) Information creation:

The production of native models and associated data must allow the creation of models in IFC. Proxy objects should not be used when there is a specific object class for this purpose in SCHEMA IFC.

The delivery team must define an origin for the project's local coordinate reference that is common to all models.

The local reference point may be rotated in relation to the North of the coordinate system, and this rotation must be established in the BIM Execution Plan with the corresponding justification.

The origin of the project's local coordinate reference point must be identified with a geometric element labelled ‘OriginOfProject’: an inverted square pyramid with a base of 0.5m and a height of 1m, with the bottom vertex coinciding with the origin.

In addition, there may also be a second point (labelled ‘Landmark’) with the same characteristics and local coordinates (1,1,0).

All models, of all disciplines, must follow a common set of building story elevations and nomenclature. 

Space objects must contain consistent information on the type, function and numbering of the room.

All object instances must be assigned to the correct building story of the building according to the building story on which they are located.

Object instances with different properties, e.g. external/internal, structural/non-structural properties, should be split into different instances. For example, a wall that runs from the inside to the outside should be divided into the building envelope.

The classification system defined in this document must be used to produce the work and quantity maps, although it is possible for the lead appointed party to propose an additional granularity of the classification system in its BEP.

The models delivered in IFC must not contain duplication of elements between different specialities. Exceptional situations must be duly categorised and justified in the BEP.

The structure of the IFC models should be uniform across all disciplines, with the nomenclature complying with the following table:

| IFC entity               | Nomenclature    |
| ------------------------ | --------------- |
| IfcProject               | OpenBIMGarden   |
| -- IfcSite               | Arroios         |

Some changes may be made at the design stage, to be proposed by the lead appointed party.

The post-contract BEP must indicate the elevation of each IfcBuildingStorey, as well as its elevation in relation to the 0.00 of the project. All disciplines must follow these same elevations.

Auxiliary work building stories are allowed in native models, but they cannot be exported to models in IFC format.

IFC models must always have the objects allocated to the corresponding IfcBuildingStorey.

In the case of editable drawings, they must be in DWG format when generated in CAD. In the case of drawings generated using BIM platforms, this requirement only applies at the end of each phase, as a deliverable. There is no requirement for the DWGs to be formatted in the same way as the PDFs of the drawings, as they are merely working documents.

---

#### b) Coordination:

Model coordination should be carried out regularly. Each appointed party should coordinate its own models as part of its quality assurance process, before sharing the information with the delivery team. Information/clarification exchanges regarding BIM models between the appointing party and the lead appointed party should preferably be carried out using BCF files in the CDE.

Any exchange of information between task teams of the same discipline must take place within their respective folder in the *Work in Progress* status of the Common Data Environment. The organisation and frequency of these exchanges is determined by the lead appointed party for their delivery team.

The information produced by each appointed party should only be shared with other appointed parties when already coordinated within each delivery team. Information exchanges between different appointed parties take place in the *Shared* state of t
he Common Data Environment. A maximum periodicity of 15 days is defined for updating models in the CDE, with at least S2 status.

---

#### c) Review and approval of information:

Each task team must carry out a quality assurance check on each information container before reviewing the information it contains.

The information review and approval process follows the flow illustrated in the figure below:

![Review and approval of information process](/Images/ReviewOfInformation.svg "Processo de revisão e aprovação da informação")


The items to be considered in the review, as well as the KPIs and checklist, are detailed below. [Acceptance table](#33-acceptance-table).

### 3.2.3. Delivery of information to the appointing party

The final deliverables will be realised using the CDE solution determined previously.

The final deliverables must move to status S5 ([table B.1](#table-b1--codes-for-the-status-of-the-information-blocks-within-the-cde)) when they are finalised within the dates determined in section 5.

---

### 3.2.4. Security

The collaborative digital working methods and technologies used in the project involve the collaborative sharing of information by a number of independent actors, and therefore the need arose to manage the vulnerability issues inherent in the availability of information in accordance with the requirements of EN ISO 19650-5. The appointing party therefore carried out a sensitivity assessment to identify whether or not a security approach was required and applied the triage process, which led to the ST4 classification. 

This classification led to the conclusion that in this project there will be no need to develop a security strategy, respective security plan, fault and incident management plans and information sharing agreements with appointed parties. However, commercial and personal information must be protected in accordance with the legislation in force, namely the GDPR. Appropriate measures must also be taken to minimise threats arising from fraudulent and other criminal activities and cybersecurity incidents.
